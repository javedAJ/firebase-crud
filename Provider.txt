 Categories of testing :
 
 1) Unit test : A unit test tests a single function , method or class.

 2) Widget test : A widget test in other ui frameworks refered to as component  test test a single a widget.

 3) Integration test : An integration test testas a complete app or large part of an app.


 What is testing : 

 	 				A piece of code to automatically validate other code.

 Why testing is important : 

 					The more features your app has , the harder it is to manually. 
 					Automated tests help ensure that your app performs correctly before you pubslih it ,
 					while retaining your features and bug fix velocity.

 		when you create a basic or small project then you dont need to perform testing but when your functionality increasing your you r not able do all testing manuallly you need a automated testig thats why testing is importamt

like using super class code into the sub classs.

Null Safety : Null Saftey makes your code safer and runs faster.

---> In Null safety we have 2 operators ? and ! .
                                        -------

for example
-----------
using ? (question mark) :->

 void main(){
 int ? x;
 print(x);
 }
------------------------ 

void main(){
	int? x; nullable variable
	int y =x!;

	print(y);
}



Dart Null Safety : Using Null Safety we are not using the unintialize variable.

if trying to running progrm with null variale then the program give you gives you an error..


For example 
------------>

void main () {
	int x;
	print(x);

}
	//this program gives you an error when null saftey is on if null saftey is off this program return null.	

void main(){
	int x=10;
	print(x);
}
 Alwyas intialize a value in variable.
